Strategic Business Plan: eufta.in
Comprehensive Operational, Regulatory, and Financial Framework for the Rotterdam-Indo Logistics Gateway
Document Version:  4.0 (Final Comprehensive Build)
Revision Date:  January 30, 2026
1. Executive Summary: The Definitive Gateway to the Single Market
The formal signing of the  European Union-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA)  on January 27, 2026, marks the most significant trade recalibration of the decade. Uniting two economic powerhouses representing 25% of global GDP and a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, the agreement provides immediate zero-duty access for over $33 billion of Indian exports. 1
eufta.in  is established in Rotterdam, the Netherlands—the maritime heart of Europe—to provide the essential physical and fiscal infrastructure required for Indian brands to capture this historic opportunity. By combining professional 3PL warehousing, deep regulatory compliance (EFSA/EMA), and advanced e-commerce enablement, eufta.in acts as a unified "back-end" for Indian D2C and B2B enterprises.
Core Value Proposition:
Fiscal Arbitrage:  Leveraging Dutch  Article 23 VAT Deferment  to eliminate the 21% upfront tax burden for importers.
Regulatory Bridge:  Deciphering complex EU health, safety, and carbon regulations (Novel Foods, GMP, REACH, CBAM).
Omnichannel Scale:  Direct fulfillment into Amazon (EU5), Zalando, Otto, Allegro, and Bol.com from a single hub.
Bidirectional Flow:  Servicing the surging Indian demand for European luxury, food, and machinery.
2. Macroeconomic Foundation: The 2026 EU-India FTA
2.1 Strategic Recalibration
The conclusion of this agreement, following nearly two decades of negotiations, represents more than just a tariff reduction; it is a geostrategic move to reduce over-reliance on traditional supply chains and integrate India into the European value-chain network. For the EU, it offers access to the world's most populous nation; for India, it provides a stable alternative to US-dominated trade corridors. 3

Agri-Food:  Olive oil and fruit juices see 45-55% tariffs eliminated over a 5-year staging period.
4. Industry-Specific EU Regulations: The Compliance Backend
A "physical backend" for Indian brands must solve the regulatory hurdles that cause 23% higher supply chain costs for unmanaged exporters.
4.1 Food, Ayush, and Wellness (EFSA Compliance)
Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 (Novel Foods):
The Problem:  Traditional Indian ingredients (e.g., Ashwagandha) often lack a "safe history of consumption" in the EU pre-May 1997.
eufta.in Solution:  We manage the  Article 4 Consultation  to prove safe use or guide brands through the 9–24 month EFSA dossier approval process.
Health Claims:  We audit packaging to ensure "Nutrition & Health Claims" (Regulation EC 1924/2006) do not make unauthorized medicinal promises.
4.2 Medicinal and Herbal Products (EMA & GMP)
Annex 21 (Importation of Medicinal Products):
Qualified Person (QP) Release:  It is a legal requirement that an EU-based QP certify each batch after lab testing in Rotterdam before release into the market.
GMP Site Audits:  We assist manufacturers in maintaining EU-GMP standards through pre-inspection audits.
4.3 Chemicals and Plastics (REACH)
Regulation (EC) 1907/2006:
Only Representative (OR):  Non-EU manufacturers cannot register chemicals directly. eufta.in acts as the  OR , handling ECHA registrations.
Fee Changes:  We manage the 19.5% increase in registration fees for large companies that took effect in late 2025.
5. Site Selection: Rotterdam (The Logistics & Fiscal Advantage)
5.1 The Article 23 VAT Arbitrage
The most powerful tool for Indian D2C brands is the  Article 23 VAT Deferment license .
Standard Rule:  Pay 21% VAT at the border. 5
Article 23 Rule:  VAT is recorded as a "reverse charge" in the periodic return. Net effect on cash flow:  Zero . 7
General Fiscal Representation:  eufta.in obtains Dutch VAT numbers for exporters and manages all quarterly filings, removing the need for a local Dutch office. 5
5.2 Multimodal Connectivity & Green Corridors
Connectivity:  Reach 170 million consumers within 24 hours of docking.
Green Initiatives:  Prioritized flow via the newly established  India-Netherlands Green and Digital Shipping Corridor , supporting hydrogen and ammonia-fueled logistics. 10
6. 3PL Service Architecture: End-to-End Enablement
6.1 Phase 1: Professional Lean Entry (The €1,000 Warehouse)
Starting with a dedicated high-efficiency unit in the Rotterdam region with a  monthly rent of €1,000  [User Input].
Space:  Securing ~150–200 
Unit Economics:  Using shared 3PL space reduces order costs from €15–€20 down to  €8–€12 . 13
6.2 Digital Onboarding & Multi-Channel Fulfillment
We provide the technical backend to go global on major platforms:
Amazon (EU5):  Full MCF integration across UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.
Fashion:  Specialized onboarding for  Zalando  (121M visitors) and  Wehkamp  (invite-only).
Eastern Europe:  Integration with  Allegro  (289M visitors), critical for volume.
Germany & Benelux:  Local trust via  Otto  (signup fee: €10k) and  Bol.com  (13.8M users).
6.3 B2B Sales & Regional Language Support
Outsourced SDR teams fluent in  German, French, and Dutch  manage professional outreach to wholesalers who value direct communication and punctuality. 14  This model converts fixed labor costs into variable, performance-linked service fees.
7. Website Architecture: eufta.in Page-by-Page Details
The website must act as a trust-building authority for Indian manufacturers.

11. Synthesis and Strategic Outlook
The 2026 EU-India FTA provides a historic window for brands to "Go Global" without the traditional high costs of cross-border entry. By establishing an expert physical and digital bridge in Rotterdam,  eufta.in  removes the primary barriers of regulatory fear and capital intensity. The model’s profitability is driven by high-margin specialized services (Article 23, QP batch release) combined with scalable fulfillment volume. As bilateral trade doubles by 2032, eufta.in is positioned to become the definitive logistics partner for the Indo-European trade era.
